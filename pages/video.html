                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p style="width: 50vw;"> The video presented by Trace Dominguez on behalf of DiscoveryNews
                    attacks the question of whether or not animals like music. The argument focuses on birds and
                    whales, both of which are harmonically inclined. Birds display rythm and percussion patterns similar
                    to those of jazz musicisians; whereas, humpback whales use a format similar to that of the Beetles.
                    Additionally, the argument includes an English study which concludes that cows milk 3% more efficiently 
                    while being stimulated by melodies which are under 100BPM. Dominguez ends off saying that music connects
                    both hemispheres of the brain, attaching meaning to sound, much like animals. This leads him to the
                    conclusion that harmonics are universal.
